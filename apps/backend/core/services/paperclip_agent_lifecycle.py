"""Chat-initiated Paperclip agent lifecycle.

When /chat intercepts an ``agents.create`` or ``agents.delete`` RPC it
needs to mirror the operation against Paperclip — otherwise the next
container reprovision rebuilds ``openclaw.json`` from the live Paperclip
list and resurrects the supposedly-deleted agent (or fails to find a
freshly-created one).

Lives in core/services/ so the router stays on its side of the
routers→services boundary and reuses ``core/services/paperclip_admin_session``
for ``httpx.AsyncClient`` + admin-cookie management.
